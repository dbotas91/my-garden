### Walk the talk

### Aggregation of marginal gains | compound effect

- [example](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits/cycling)
    
    - Identify tiny margins of improvement in everything you do.
    
    - Break down everything you can think of a goal, then improve it by 1% then put them altogether.

- “Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you". Time decides it.

    If you can get 1% better/worse each day, you will be 37 times better/worse than when you begin.
    
    - “Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.”
    
    - You get what you repeat
        
        - Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.
        
        - Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits.
        
        - Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits.
        
        - Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.
        
        - Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits.

- Current trajectory > current results
    
    - "A very small shift in direction can lead to a meaningful change in destination."
    
    - “If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.”

### Goals vs systems

- Goals = results you want (setting a direction)
    
    - Purpose = win the game
    
    - Goals restrict your happiness. "Once I.... , then I'll be...". Fall in love with the process, not the end.
    
    - "Winners and losers have the same goals."

- Systems = processes leading to those results. (helping you get there)
    
    - Purpose = continue playing the game
    
    - Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.
    
    - "The score take care of itself.

- Set goals → focus on systems.
    
    - “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”
    
    - Fix the input then the output changes.

### Breakthrough = result of many previous actions

- “Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.”
    
    - "Your work is not wasted. It is just being stored."
    
    - If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed “Plateau of Latent Potential.”

        “When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success.”
        

- Small changes
    
    - “Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.”
    
    - “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.” —Jacob A. Riis
