### ⚡Summary

[

After the Quake - Wikipedia

(神の子どもたちはみな踊る, after the quake Kami no Kodomo-tachi wa Mina Odoru, lit. "All God's Children Can Dance") is a collection of six short stories by Japanese author Haruki Murakami, written between 1999 and 2000. First published in Japan in 2000, it was released in English as after the quake in 2002 (translator Jay Rubin notes that Murakami "insisted" the title "should be all lower-case").

### 🗣️Comment

I picked up this book because of the author himself, who wrote Kafka On The Shore, a book which I adored a lot. But, this collection of short stories is truly a whole new level of writing. Some stories aren't clearly explained as in you don't know the plot fully and where the author is going, but they are still amazing. Weird is the word I would describe them, but they are unique at the same time. That is the beauty of writing. Limitless.

I particularly enjoy the final story called Honey Pies, for it is a romance genre. Besides, the male protagonist is a writer as well so I got to see how the future of becoming a writer looks like, and how I feel more attracted to this passion. This finale has a bittersweet, but a happy ending.

### 🏡Takeaway

- Become a writer. Use the power of words to heal the world.

> If you devote all of your future energy to living, you will not be able to die well. You must begin to shift gears, a little at a time. Living and dying are, in a sense, of equal value.

> A fire can be any shape it wants to be. It's free. So it can look like anything at all depending on what's inside the person looking at it. If you get this deep, quiet kind of feeling when you look at a fire, that's because it's showing you the deep, quiet kind of feeling you have inside yourself.
