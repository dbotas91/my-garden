### Summary

The book's theme is mortality:[[1\|1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_One_More_Day#cite_note-newport-mortality-1) it analyzes how people might react to the chance to have a dead relative back for a day.[[2\|2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_One_More_Day#cite_note-dv-perks-2)

The book tells the story of Charles "Chick" Benetto, a former baseball player who encounters a myriad of problems with his career, finances, family and alcohol abuse. This leads him to become suicidal. Charles goes on a drunken rampage and decides he is going to end his life in his old home town, but when he misses the exit, he turns around driving down the wrong side of the highway causing an accident, Benetto flees to his old home – his suicide attempt an apparent failure – to see his mother, who had died eight years prior.

Benetto returns to his old family home, and spends one more day with his mother, where in a number of previously unknown factors related to his difficult childhood and troubled relationship with his father are revealed to him. His mother assists him in resolving his issues and getting his life back on track. The day ends when Benetto regains consciousness at the scene of the accident in a police officer's arms.

The book's epilogue describes how Benetto was inspired by his experience to quit drinking and reconcile with family, including his daughter, Maria, before his death five years later. At the end, Maria is revealed to have been the narrator of the story.

### Comment

For One More Day by Mitch Albom is a book to read as a reminder to love your mother, to listen when she speaks, and to be there when she needs. It is a book reminding you the meaning of family and marriage, as well as the love you ought to devote to them. I love how a quote from this book,

> When it's quiet, I can hear my mother's echo still.

And I interpreted it as

> When you are here with your heart and soul, when you are present without a loss in attention, and when you are silent enough that you can hear your heart beating and your life living, you would see the person whom you love the most.

I love my mother. There were times she stood up for me and times I did not stand up for her. I believe I hated myself more than anyone else for my impetuous, incompetence and impatience. But, as soon as I have quieted down, I could hear my mom, those whom I hold dear saying,

> forgive, and live.

### Quote

> Have you ever lost someone you love and wanted one more conversation, one more chance to make up for the time when you thought they would be here forever? If so, then you know you can go your whole life collecting days, and none will outweigh the one you wish you had back.  
>   
> What if you got it back? —page 3

> "So," she said, moving away, "now you know how badly someone wanted you, Charley. Children forget that sometimes. They think of themselves as a burden instead of a wish granted." —page 73

> When a lost loved one appears before you, it's your brain that fights it, not your heart. —page 78

> She shot me a look, "Remember, Charley. Sometimes kids want you to hurt the way they hurt." —page 89

> "A child embarrassed by his mother," she said, "is just a child who hasn't lived long enough." —page 90

> "Things can be fixed," she said —page 108

> I know you don't want love life advice from me, but even if girls find you handsome, that is not a license to be mean. Be nice. —page 109

> It's such a lucky thing you have to be taught and to be learning and not have to be working in a shop somewhere. —page 110

> In college, I had a course in Latin, and one day the word "divorce" came up. I always figured it came from some root that meant "divide." In truth, it comes from "divertere," which means "to divert."  
>   
> I believe that. All divorce does is divert you, taking you away from everything you thought you knew and everything you thought you wanted and steering you into all kinds of other stuff, like discussions about your mother's girdle and whether she should marry someone else. —page 127-128

> "Mom, I can always go back to school," This time the silence was longer. She said only one more thing before we hung up: "Going back to something is harder than you think."  
>   
> I don't suppose I could have broken my mother's heart any more if I tried. —page 133

> "But..." I stumbled for words. "You couldn't do the work that mattered to you."  
>   
> My mother looked at me with a glint of defiance.  
>   
> "I did what mattered to me," she said. "I was a mother." —page 135

> Here is what you are going to find out about marriage: you have to work at it together. And you have to love three things. You have to love  
>   
> 1) Each other  
> 2) Your children (When you have some! Hint! Hint!)  
> 3) Your marriage  
>   
> What I mean by that last one is, there may be times that you fight, and sometimes you and Catherine won't even like each other. But those are the times you have to love your marriage. It's like a third party. Look at your wedding photos. Look at any memories you've made. And if you believe in those memories, they will pull you back together. —page 137-138

> "Once Heaven is done with grandma, we'd like her back, thanks." —page 149

> Do you eve think while something is happening, about what's happening someplace else? My mother, after the divorce, would stand on the back porch at sunset, smoking a cigarette, and she'd say, "Charley, right now, as the sun is going down here, it's coming up someplace else in the world. Australia or China or someplace. You can look it up in the encyclopedia."  
>   
> "It's such a big world," she'd say, wistfully. "Something is always happening somewhere. —Page 169

> "You have one family, Charley. For good or bad. You have one family. You can't trade them in. You can't lie to them. You can't run two at once, substituting back and forth.  
>   
> "Sticking with your family is what _makes_ it a family." —page 183

> "I gave up," I whispered.  
> "Don't give up," she whispered back. —page 187

> I could still hear his words, forcing my decision: _mama's boy or daddy's boy, Chick? What's it gonna be?_"I made the wrong choice," I whispered.  
> My mother shook her head.  
> "A child should never have to choose." —page 188

> "Me and my mother," I mumbled.  
> I felt a soft kiss on my forehead.  
> "My mother and I," she corrected.  
> And she was gone. —page 192

> "What causes an echo?" she once quizzed me.  
> _The persistence of sound after the source has stopped.  
> _"When can you hear an echo?"  
> _When it's quiet and other sounds are absorbed.  
> _When it's quiet, I can hear my mother's echo still. —page 193

> But there's a story behind everything. How a picture got on a wall. How a scar got on your face. Sometimes the stories are simple, and sometimes they are hard and heartbreaking. But behind all your stories is always your mother's story, because hers is where yours begins. —page 194

> And even though Chick is gone now, his story flows through others. It flows through me. I don't think he was crazy. I think he really did get one more day with his mother. **And one day spent with someone you love can change everything.** —page 197
