> “The process of behavior change always _**starts with awareness**_. You need  
> to be aware of your habits before you can change them.”

### Pointing-and-Calling

- Used mainly in Japan.

- raises awareness level from a **non-conscious** habit to a more conscious level by verbalising your actions.

- Use the habits scorecard
    
    - Lay out all the actions during a session of your day eg. morning routine
    
    - Score each action and ask if it is a good habit, bad habit or neutral.
    
    - “If you’re having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, ask  
        yourself: ‘Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?’”
