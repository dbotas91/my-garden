💡

Change your identity and prove that that is who you are with small wins as the evidence.  
Change what you do so that you have the evidence to prove who you are.

1. Why is it hard to change a habit?
    
    1. **We try to change the wrong thing.**
    
    2. We try to change in the wrong way.

2. 3 layers of change
    
    1. [Outermost layer] Outcome - what you get
    
    2. [Middle layer] Process - what you do
    
    3. [Innermost layer] Identity - what you believe

3. Identity-based habits > Outcome-based habits
    
    - "I'm trying to quit smoking" — You still think of yourself as a smoker. You just don't smoke much now even though you thought you don't smoke anymore.
    
    - "I'm not a smoker."
    
    - "I'm horrible at math." ⇒ **you find ways to resist anything that contradicts to this identity you believe in**, even though it isn't what you really want.
    
    - The goal is not to run a marathon. The goal is become a runner.
    
    - The goal is not to read a book. The goal is become a reader.
    
    - Make the habit a part of your identity.
    
    - If you're proud of your biceps, you won't skip any workouts. Your pride helps you go on.
    
    - **You identity yourself as being "some type of person" or "someone", you will act one.**

4. How is your identity formed in the first place? [Your identity isn't set in stone. It can be changed.]
    
    - You're not born with preset beliefs. You identity is determined by your habit being the evidence.
    
    - You read because you're a reader. You make your bed because you're a disciplined. You write because you're a writer.
    
    - An automated, repeated habit shapes and supports your identity.
    
    - **Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your belief (identity). But as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.**
    
    - Feedback loop — To change who you are, you change what you do, and vice versa.
    
    - You don't need to be perfect. You don't need to worry about casting a few votes for the bad habit. _In any elections, you don't have secure all the votes for you. You just need enough to get the simple majority._
    
    - Ask yourself,
        
        - Who is the type of person who can write a book?
        
        - Think what traits and habits does this type of person have. Then, tailor your life to become that person.

5. Habits don't help you to do something. They help you to become someone.
