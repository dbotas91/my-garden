# “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”

- People talk about getting “amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes down to passion.” Or, “You have to really want it.” As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that ==they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.==

- As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”

- I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting.
    
    - When you start a business, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up.
    
    - When you’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like finishing.
    
    - When it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t feel like typing.
    
    - But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.

- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.

- David Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his students to avoid being “fair-weather meditators.” Similarly, you don’t want to be a fair-weather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather anything. When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood. Professionals take action even when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy it, but they find a way to put the reps in.
    
    - There have been a lot of sets that I haven’t felt like finishing, but I’ve never regretted doing the workout.
    
    - There have been a lot of articles I haven’t felt like writing, but I’ve never regretted publishing on schedule.
    
    - There have been a lot of days I’ve felt like relaxing, but I’ve never regretted showing up and working on something that was important to me.
