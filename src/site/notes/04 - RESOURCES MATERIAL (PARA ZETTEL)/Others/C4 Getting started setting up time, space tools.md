### Everything is about tricks.

- The smart you set things up to trick yourself into doing or not doing later.

- Tricks are for the not-so-smart, not-so conscious part of us so that we just follow the plan set up earlier.

> It is easier to act yourself into a better way of feeling than to feel yourself into a better way of action. —O.H. Mowrer

- That means it's easier to do something which leads to better feelings than to secure good moods to do something better.

- Eg. If on exercise gear, you feel more like exercising and vice versa.
    - Because the friction is minimal.

- Eg. You took something home and must bring it back tomorrow.
    - You leave it at an obvious place so that the next day, you would see it and remember to bring it back.

- Principle: Put It in Front of the Door
    - Trick yourself into doing or not doing something by preparing for the process upfront so that you feel the least friction to do the thing later.

> You increase your productivity and creativity exponentially when you think about the right things at the right time and have the tools to capture your value-added thinking.

### Setting up space

- Have a workspace you enjoy getting things done at.

- Even if you have the workspace in an office, you still need one at home.

- Don't share space even with your partner. Everyone has their own purpose of using a workspace.

### Calendar

- Calendar should not be used to hold actions but to track "hard landscape" of things have to get done at a specific time.

### Wastebasket/Recycling Bins

- You need a place to throw away wastes easily within your reach.

- Wastes are like paper wastes, eraser rubbings, broken pencil lead etc.

> One of the best tricks for enhancing your personal productivity is having organizing tools you love to use.

### Filing system: drawers

- Keep your drawer <3/4 full.

- Otherwise, you will unconsciously resist to put things into the drawer. But instead, you'll stack them up on your table which eventually costing space on your table.

- So what to discard?
    
    - Materials such as finished project notes and "dead" files may still be kept, but can be stored off-site or at least out of your workspace.
    
    - Basically, you need also an archive section in your filing system
