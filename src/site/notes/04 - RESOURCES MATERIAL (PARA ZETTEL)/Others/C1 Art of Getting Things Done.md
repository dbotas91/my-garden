# The Principle: Dealing Effectively with Internal Commitments

> Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an "open loop" pulling on your attention. -DA

- There're a lot of possible tasks and commitments "knocking at your office door" every day.

- These tasks and commitments may range from ending world hunger (huge & long-term) to replacing a pencil sharpener (small & tedious).

- You get stressed because you inappropriately accept these tasks and commitments but can't manage them properly.

## Basic Requirements for Managing Commitments

1. Capture
    
    - If it's on your mind, your mind isn't clear. This affects your current workflow too.
    
    - Anything you consider unfinished or not even started (like ideas on your mind) must be **captured in an external trusted system.**
    
    - You will review regularly to sort them out.

2. Clarify & decide
    - Clarify exactly what your commitment is and decide what actions you have to take to fulfil the commitment.

3. Remind
    - Once decided on actions to be taken, note them down in a system you can review regularly to remind you of what needs to get done for the commitment you took up.

### Exercise

_Write down the project/situation that is most on your mind at this moment. What most "bugs" you, distracts you, or interests you, or in some other way consumes a large part of your conscious attention?_

_It may be a project or problem that is really "in your face," something you are being pressed to handle, or a situation you feel you must deal with sooner rather than later._

- **Answer**
    
    Mastering A-levels (AS and A2 syllabi).
    

- **Intended successful outcome in 1 sentence**
    
    > What would need to happen for you to check this "project" off as "done"?
    
    Obtain 4A*
    

- **The very next physical action required to move the situation forward**
    
    > If you had nothing else to do in your life but get closure on this, where would you go right now, and what visible action would you take?
    
    I would find out what needs to be revised actively in order to be at least 90% prepared before my mock exam in August.
    

- **Was there any value to you in these 2 minutes of thinking?**
    
    I feel a very slight bit of clarity for what my nearest huge target is â€” August mock exam.
    

> Think like a man of action, act like a man of thought.' â€”Henry Bergson

- What probably happened is I acquire a clearer definition of my desired outcome and the next action for this project.

## Real Work of Knowledge Work

What are the expected results from this work?

- There is usually no right answer, but decisions for what results you want.

- So, you have to clearly specify the results you want beforehand, then only productivity is achieved.

- We can't walk properly if the path ahead is unseen.

Much of the things we do are already defined for us, by our typical commitments like family to be fed, roles as a student etc.

- So, most people don't think it's necessary to think about our work & the desired outcomes before they do it.

## Why things are on your mind

It's because you want things to be different than it currently is but:

- No clarification of intended outcomes.
    - You don't know what you want from this project.

- No decision on the very next physical action.
    - You don't know what to do next.

- No reminders of the outcome and actions required in a system you trust.
    - You tend to forget what you want from and have to do for this project.

Your mind knows if the clear conclusion for a project is reached or if the necessary steps are noted down or taken for the project. If not, you'll keep being pressured by your mind until you do what needs to be done. Until then, you feel stressed out.

## Your mind doesn't have a mind of its own

Your mind cannot store information.

It can't tell you to do something until you can do something about it

- You have flashlight with dead batteries in it.

- You only know you have to change the batteries when you come across batteries in the shop or when you want to use the flashlight.

> Rule your mind or it will rule you.

# The Process: Managing Action

We don't manage time, manage info or manage priorities.

- X manage 5 mins then end up with 6 mins.

- X manage info overload â€” enter library then you die cuz too much info

- X manage priorities â€” we _have_ them

We manage our actions.

- What you **do** with your time

- What you **do** with info

- What you **do** with your body and focus relative to priorities

We're usually overwhelmed because we "think" we have no time to do_____ , but we actually don't lack time, we lack clear definition about what a project is, and what next physical steps can be to finish the project.

ðŸ’¡

Define project clearly, outcomes that you can consider the project as done, and next actions which can bring closer towards completing the project.

### Value of a Bottom-Up Approach

> Vision is not enough; it must be combined with venture. It is not enough to stare up the steps; we must step up the stairs. â€”Vaclav Havel

- It's totally okay to have visions and the desire to achieve the greatest heights.

- But, going from the bottom up (starting from the most mundane but useful actions) will take you there.

- Rather than just looking at the highest goal every day but not taking any significant action because you feel overwhelmed by how many steps you need to take to get where you want.

ðŸ’¡

In short, one step at a time, however small, will get you to where you want to be, because you're moving forward.

### Major Change: Getting It All Out of Your Head

- Capture & organize 100% of "stuff" in a trustworthy system, not in your mind, whether it is small or big, personal or professional, urgent or not. Everything that is an idea, a task or the next step towards achieving what you want.
    - Stuff = an isolated idea or thought which is not noted down, and so has no trusted place to be. It will keep coming up in your mind until you do something about it or insert it in a trusted system.

- Don't waste time thinking about something more than once.
    
    > There is no reason to have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.
    

- If something is undecided or unclarified (still a "stuff"), it will be stored in short-term memory.

- Short-term memory, like RAM on a PC, has limited capacity. So you can't store everything that comes up in your mind, hoping that you will somehow rmb to take action later by retrieving them.

- Our mind usually wanders off into some other areas not relevant to what you're doing right now, like reading this page.
    
    - You usually have some investment in those areas, but until they're written down in a trusted system, those thoughts will keep coming up.
    
    - In the end, you become easily distracted and anxious about many things because your RAM is full and you can't take it anymore.

- Most of the time, you can easily get overwhelmed with a lot of things to complete. The more this kind of thoughts come up, the more you think you should be doing them right now, regardless of most important and urgent priorities you're dealing with now.

- If you choose to store everything in your brain, RAM will be overload and you will feel bad for not completing what your brain tells you to do.
