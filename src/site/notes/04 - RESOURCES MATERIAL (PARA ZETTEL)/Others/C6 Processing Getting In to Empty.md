This chapter follows after collecting everything that demands your attention and actions.

### Getting "In" to Empty

- "In" means everything that demands your attention and actions, which you've collected just now from everywhere.

- Emptying "In" doesn't mean doing the actions now.

- But, identify each action and decide what to do about it as follows:

### Processing Guidelines

1. Process the top item first.
    
    - Principle: everything gets processed equally.
    
    - Process does not mean "spend time on".
    
    - It means deciding what the stuff is and what action is required then dispatch it accordingly.
    
    - Emergency scanning isn't processing
        
        - You'll inevitably leave something unprocessed.
        
        - You'll spend extra time to decide which stuff to be processed FIRST.
    
    - Going from the top to the bottom allows you to process everything without spending time on deciding which one to begin first.

2. Process 1 item at a time.
    
    - You feel less burdened when dealing with just 1 thing.
    
    - You'll give your 100% attention to 1 thing only.

3. Never put anything back into "in".
    - Otherwise, you won't finish processing.

### What's the next action?

- Some actions aren't self-evident.

- You need fast, hard thinking to decide what next steps to take to complete the project.

- What if there's no action? There're 3 types:
    
    1. Trash
    
    2. Items to incubate
        
        - There's nothing to do on this now, but they might be later.
        
        - Eg.
            
            - An agenda for a board meeting you've been invited to attend in three weeks. No action is required on it, other than your briefing yourself a day ahead of the meeting by reading the agenda.
            
            - A flier announcing a chamber of commerce breakfast with a guest speaker you might want to hear, but it's two weeks away, and you're not sure yet if you'll be at home then or out of town on a business trip.
            
        
        - 2 things you can do with them
            
            1. Write them on a "Someday/Maybe" list.
            
            2. Put them on your calendar or in a "tickler" file.
        
        - This gets them off your mind now, knowing that there's a reminder system which let you know to handle them later.
    
    3. Reference material
        
        - Store amazing info that resonates with you in Resonance Calendar. Done.
        
        - 2 ways of dealing with whether or not to keep something for future reference. Pick one.
            
            - When in doubt, throw it out.
            
            - When it doubt, keep it.
        
        - If the storing system isn't easy, fast and fun, you'll not organize.
        
        - If you can't get it into your system immediately, you won't do it now, you won't do it later either.
