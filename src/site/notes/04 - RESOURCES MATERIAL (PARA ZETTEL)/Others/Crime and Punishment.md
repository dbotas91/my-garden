### 🗣️Comment

Addictive. Got me hooked when I started reading it on bed after midnight until I chose to sacrifice few hours of sleep. Finished in just two days.

Blablabla I really don't know what else to write. This book is just an interesting read. Not much lesson can be interpreted from it. I just like the way how the author got us hooked into the atmosphere of the story.

### 🏡Takeaway

1. Lack of connection with other human beings or with society as a whole will change you mentally, for the worse, of course.
    - The main theme of this book is about alienation and how the suffering it brings together with poverty can make someone commit crimes while justifying it.

2. No crime is justified. No one is exempted from sins, guilt and doubts from committing crimes.
    
    > Kill her, take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? ... One death, and a hundred lives in exchange—it's simple arithmetic! —Student in tavern
    
    - Despite what the book says, even if there are two categories of men, no man, including the extraordinary ones can decide if a person should live or die.
        
        💡
        
        The question to abolish death roll comes into action here. Do we have the right to decide a person's life and death, even if he or she has committed sins that are unbearable?
        
    
    - Remember the trolley problem: Why and how should one decide if it is more rational to save five people's lives by sacrificing one? Why isn't it the other way around?

3. Killing someone burdens the killer for his or her entire life.

### 🗨️Quotes

💡

Part of conversation between Rodion and Petrovitch.

> There are men who have an absolute right to commit all kinds of wicked acts, men for whom laws don't exist. You describe two categories of men: ordinary men who must be obedient and follow the laws of the land, and extraordinary men who have a right to commit every kind of crime and break every law because of their superior character. —protagonist's law journal

> My theory is that an extraordinary man can be guided by his conscience, even if that means breaking the law and committing a criminal act. He may do this in order to benefit mankind. —protagonist

> Think about this: all great rulers have been criminals because they have created new laws which have forced them to break the old ones. In consequence, all men who want to achieve something new, something extraordinary, must be willing to commit crimes in order to overcome any barriers that might be in their path.

> Nature divides men into two categories: the first is ordinary inferior men who are born to produce children, to love and to obey and follow the laws of the land. The second class of men, however, consists of extraordinary men who destroy what exists in order to create something that _should_ exist. While carrying out their plans for a new society, these extraordinary men have the right to commit crimes, to murder and even to start wars — but only if these acts lead to something better for mankind.

> Society needs both categories of man — one to produce children and to maintain ordinary life, and the other to excite mankind and to make people act for change.

But,

> ...For example, if a young man sees himself as a great leader with big ideas, his first step will be to destroy every barrier that stands in his way, which means stealing to get money and murdering to get rid of his enemies.

> But society has laws, ... and the police will catch this imaginary man and stop him — and even if he's clever enough to avoid capture, he'll have to live with his own conscience. He'll know that he's sinned and will pity his victims. He'll suffer from guilt and doubts, but he'll have to live with this suffering in order to achieve his goals.

💡

When Rodion bowed down to Sonia and kissed her feet.

> I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity.
