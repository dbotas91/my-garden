> If you have a list of calls you must make, for example, the minute that list is not totally current with all the calls you need to make, your brain will not trust the system, and it won't get relief from its lower-level mental tasks. It will have to take back the job of remembering, processing, and reminding.

- Basically, the external system you created is now useless.

- So, you need to review regularly.

> People often ask me, "How much time do you  
> spend looking at your system?" My answer is simply,  
> "As much time as I need to to feel comfortable about  
> what I'm doing."

Order of review (decreasing frequency)

1. Calendar and daily recurring actions.
    - To know what needs to get done with respect to time.

2. Lists of all actions you could possibly do next.

### Weekly Review

1. You can't do this intense re-evaluation daily because you're trying to get everyday work done.

2. But, you just have to book 1 day weekly.

3. Review "Projects" (and Larger Outcome) Lists
    
    - Evaluate the status of projects, goals, and outcomes one by one, ensuring that at least one current kick-start action for each is in your system.
