### ⚡Summary

A better book about habit-building.

### 🗣️Comment

It’s like an upgrade from [📕The Power of Habit](The%20Power%20of%20Habit%20b4b46ae8495d48a8a8c0cd8feae5ee34.html). More practical advices and better ways of understanding habits.

### 🗨️Quotes

At this point, I don’t know how to distinguish “Takeaway” and “Quotes” as both of them are similar.
