# 1% Better - Power of Compounding

For any project, try to do only 1% better each time, it would be 37 times better than you first started.

A habit will not show its positive impact in your life until a certain time threshold. To get to that point, you have to maintain self-discipline to be consistent.

> Time magnifies the margin between success & failure.  
> It will multiply whatever you feed it.  
> Good habits make time your ally.  
> Bad habits make time your enemy. - _Atomic Habits_, James Clear

# Screw Goals

Focus on systems instead.

### Winners and losers have the same goals

Ideas dump for a successful Project Override

1. Build all systems on identity change.
    
    > "I'm a healthy person, therefore I will eat healthily and exercise daily."
    

2. Cue → Craving → Response → Reward. Hack this loop.
    
    1. Make the environment more painful for bad habits but more conducive for the alternatives.
        - Have more steps (frictions) for bad habits and less for the alternatives.
    
    2. Limit the cues for bad habits.
        
        - Without cues in the first place, you won't be triggered thus you won't need to activate the defense system.
        
        - Keep the reward.
        
        - Change the response, then the craving will change.
            - Instead of craving for 3.5, I will crave for a better alternative when the same cue arises.
