Trial & error when you face a problem for the first time. You try to use the most effective course of action until you stumble an unexpected reward. Then, you know those actions you take are the ones you should do next time to get the same reward. In the next and following times, you’ll be do them automatically without thinking & any trials and errors. Just the cue, craving for the reward, automatic response to get the reward you want.

> Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it.

If you’re forced to make decisions every time on menial tasks, you have less freedom in your mind.

### 4 Parts of a Habit

1. Cue
    
    - Internal & external environment for primary or secondary rewards (money, fame, praise, friendship etc.) that promote primary rewards (primitive ones)
    
    - They are meaningless until they are interpreted

2. Craving
    
    > What you crave is not the habit itself, but the change in states it delivers.
    
    - You’re not motivated by brushing your teeth (habit), but a clean mouth (change in states; reward)

3. Response
    - You can only do a habit if you’re capable of doing it and if you can do it without much effort.

4. Reward
    - The more and faster the reward satisfies your craving, the better it is to be remembered and repeated next time.

- If any part is gone, a habit will not occur.

> The cue triggers the craving which motivates the response which provides the reward which satisfies that craving and automatically becomes associated with the cue.

### 2 Phases

1. Problem: Cue and craving (you realise something needs to change)

2. Solution: Response and reward (take actions to achieve the change)

> the purpose of every habit is to solve the problem you face.

### 4 Laws of Behaviour Change

1. (Cue) Make it obvious

2. (Craving) Make it attractive

3. (Response) Make it easy

4. (Reward) Make it satisfying

- Do the opposite if you want to break a bad habit.

- This list is not exhaustive but they are close.
