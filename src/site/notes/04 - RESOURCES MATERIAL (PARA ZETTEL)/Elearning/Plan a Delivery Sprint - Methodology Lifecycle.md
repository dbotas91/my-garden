# Plan a Delivery Sprint

To plan a delivery sprint its needed to:

- Determine team capacity;

- Define Sprint Backlog;

- Validate estimate for each user story - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13;

- Define tasks for each user story in the sprint:
    
    - Assign a resource to each task;
    
    - Estimate each task;

- Add new user stories and tasks as needed;

- Repeat steps 1-5 until sprint capacity is full

---

# 1. Planning best practices

- Standardize sizing guidelines to improve predictability across the program;

- Standardize the task list before loading the Product Backlog;

- Prioritize the release Backlog to facilitate planning;

- Move stories to sprints according to the Conceptual Sprint Plan;
    - Enter capacity for each sprint to see how loaded the sprint is;

- Dedicate the team to sprint planning at the start of each sprint
    
    - Validate estimates during sprint planning;
    
    - Build time into the project for this activity;

- Add all tasks to in-scope during sprint planning, not in middle of the sprint;

- Only estimate tasks and hours for stories in the current sprint;

- Refine the plan each sprint based on new information regarding priorities, business value risks, dependencies and defects.
