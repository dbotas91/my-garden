# 1. SurePath Approach

One of the four principles of SurePath is to “Levarage Guidewire content for common needs” to reduce project effor, lessen or eliminate design work and stramline implementations plans.

Image

In this high-level view of Guidewire Implementation Project Lifecycle, you can see the key activities for each phase using the SurePath approach:

- Pre-Inception and Inception: this activities set up the project for success.

- Development and Stabilization: involve activities for getting the work done, including building and testing the solution - each of these phase repeats iteratively.

- Deployment: this activities are all about getting ready to go into production.

Post deployment there are activities to further provide support of the implementation with handoff to other teams for production support and ongoing maintenance; as well as measuring and refining the value delivered as cutomers return to business as usual.

Image

---

# 2. Resource categories

The key resources available to project teams for InsuranceSuite implementations typically fall into these categories:

1. Guidewire Training Resource;

2. Documentation / references

3. Guidewire Products & Frameworks

4. Tools & Templates;

5. Experts.

Every role on a project team can find resources from each of these categories to help guide them through a Guidewire Implementation.

To enable the SurePath approach, Guidewire offers over 5000 assets and resources that can be leveraged throughout the phases of the project life cycle.

- Beginning in Pre-Inception: tools of estimation, scoping, planning and variance reporting such as the Request For Proposal - RFP Estimator and Customer Questionnaire

- During Inception: planning resources as the Release Planner with Variance Report and the Conceptual Sprint Plan

- Inception to Development: resources for enabling requirements elaboration like training content, mindmaps, process flows, Integration High Level Designs - HLDs and User Story Cards

- Development: include Product Guides, Best practices and standards Guides, Data Dictionaries and product development tools like Guidewire Studio, Advanced Product Desginer and Accelerators or Extension packs.

- Stabilization: Guidewire provides frameworks for testing such as the InsuranceSuite Behavior Testing Framework and other testing framewroks

- Deployment: Guidewire offers Deployment Plan templates an end user training content through EasyGuide.

# 3. Agile Roles for Project Teams

A Sprint team is compromised of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master and a Development team including:

- Subject Matter Experts;

- Experts from other Speciality areas;

- Quality Analysts;

- Developers;

- Business Analysts

All the Sprint Team members provide cross-functional knowledge and expertise, commit to completing the backlog items selected for the sprint and communicate blockers as early as possible in order to deliver results. Next, we will examine the typical activities for each specific role during an implementation.

Image

1. The Product owner (PO) or Product Manager
    
    The Product Owner or PO, is a key stakeholder on a project team who represents the voice of the customer. They will share their vision for the solution and collaborate with the development team to develop and deliver the work.
    
    Ex. Answer the development team’s questions to help define requirements. However they are not involved in the actual writing of requirements or tests during development.
    
    They typically have the business authority to make decisions for the project or they can delegate to other subject matter experts. In the end of the sprint, they are responsible for signing of on user stories and defects. Overall, they are responsible for driving the value of the project to ensure the business benefits from the final solution.
    
    Image
    

2. Scrum Master/Project Manager
    
    Another key role for the project team is the Project Manager or Scrum Master
    
    - They are responsible for supporting the sprint team in accomplishing their assigned tasks;
    
    - They facilitate the agile process with scrum principles, enable self-organization, and get impediments out of the way to help the team to achieve hyper-productivity;
    
    - Ideally, the project manager act as a participatory leader, not a dictating manager or servant leader;
    
    - Overall, they facilitate progress in completing the project;
    
    Project Managers often work in dual roles and where multiple hats on Guidewire Implementations - serving as Scrum Master, facilitator and assisting the team with gathering requirements, configuration, development and testing during the sprint.
    
    Image
    

3. Sprint Team
    
    The three most common team members found on sprint teams are Business Analysts, Developers and Quality Analysts.
    
    - Business Analyst (BA)
    
    This role perform similar functions on an Agile project as they do on a Waterfall project.
    
    - Works with end users to understand business requirements;
    
    - Act as a liaison with all stakeholders to ensure clear communication between business and technical groups;
    
    - Documents business requirements including high-level process flows, business rules, forms and documents, and typelist values;
    
    - Assists with defining functional requirements and workflow documentation;
    
    - Works closely with Developers and TEsters during sprint execution so the right features are built and function as the business needs
    
    - Is always facused on demonstrating value for the end users
    
    - Will perform demonstrations of the solution to the Product Owner for Approval.
    
    In some organizations, Business analysts are divided into two separate Roles: Business Analyts and a Business Systems Analyst or Technical BA. The role of the Business System Analyst is similar to the Business Analyst, but they are at a higher technical level.
    
    They will:
    
    - Coordinate all technical requirements related to the Guidewire products, customer source systems and integrations.
    
    - Document gaps and integrations and assists in the creation of design documents
    
    - Provide impact analysis of downstream systems
    
    - Work closely with Developers and Testers during sprint execution so the right features are built and function end to end throughout all impacted systems
    
    - Documents transformation and cleansing rules (ex. Data migration)
    
    - Produce mapping documentation (ex. Document production)
    
    - Subject Matter Expert (SME)
        
        Another member of the project team is the Subject Matter Expert or SME.
        
        They are responsible for:
        
        - Defining business objectives and future-state processes
        
        - Participating in requirements gathering sessions
        
        - Reviewing and help refine process flows, use cases and system requirements
        
        - Answering questions from business analysts or technical team members about desired system functionality.
        
    
    - Developer
    
    The main role of the Developer is to work with the Business, the Bas and SMEs, to understand and develop technical requirements.
    
    They are responsible for creating design documentation, writing the code to configure the application or integrate it with other applications/systems.
    
    They will also support test activities during sprint execution to ensure a high-quality, working piece of software is delivered including:
    
    - Executing unit testing
    
    - Resolving defects
    
    - Conducting peer code reviews
    
    - Reviewing test plans and test cases
    
    - Quality Analyst
    
    The role of Tester or Quality Analyst is to initially, work with the BA’s and SME’s to understand the requirments and develop test scenarios for each of the following scenarios:
    
    - The Main process or “Happy Path”
    
    - The Alternate process
    
    - The Exeception flow
    
    When development is complete, they will execute these tests and coordinate with Developers accordingly to:
    
    - Validate that features are developedper requirements
    
    - Confirm if an issue is a defect
    
    - Monitor defects and retest as needed
    
    - Role of Specialists
    
    Another role that can be found on Sprint Teams are Specialists like Database Administrators or DBAs, System Engineers, Security Specialist, Architects and more. Individuals in there roles are highly specialized and in short supply; there fore, these specialists often support the needs of multiple IT projects, production systems or both. Sometimes specialists will be brought together to create a “system team” to meet the needs of the Guidewire Implementation.
    
    ## Team success factors
    
    Some factors that contribute to the success of project teams are:
    
    - Frequent communication amongst and between team members - BAs, QAs and Developers
    
    - Teams that are empowered with decision-making authority
    
    - Active business involvement
    
    - High quality resources
    
    When present, these factors result in a better implementations, improved efficiency, increased accountability and higher quality solutions.

# 4. Resources for Pre-Inception

During Pre-Inception - Pre-project - there are activities that occur before and after the customer commits to moving forward with an InsuranceSuite Implementation.

Before the sale the Pre-Inception - Discovery Phase, Guidewire Sales bids on a new opportunity using an introductory estimate: RFP Estimate. Sales demonstrations are presented to the customer to review product functionality and identify high-level business requirements. Any configuration requirements are reviewed in an Implementation Workshop to refine the scope and estimate for the project. The business case is also completed during the Pre-Inception Discovery phase and any Value Consulting Workshops that are needed to help determine the business value for the implementation.

After the customer commits to the InsuranceSuite Implementation, the main goal of the Pre-Inception phase turns to Inception Readiness. Time is spent preparing and planning for the Inception phase of the project. For example, project preparing and planning for the Inception phase of the project. For example, project governance is defined, role definitions and responsabilities assignment are documented. Business methodology to align all with Guidewire’s SurePath approach and the project tools are identified. Finally, the Inception logistics are established along with the scheduling of Inception Workshops.

To perform these Pre-Inception activities, there are resources for estimation, scoping, planning and variance reporting such as: the Request or Proposal - RFP Estimator and Customer Questionnaire, Value Cosnulting, Strategic Value and Benefits maps, Implementation Workshop whiteboards in Mire and presentation templated Inception Planning Checklist, Release Planning and Variance Reports.

Image

Guidewire’s consulting services can be valuable resource during Pre-Inception for carriers who would like assistance with establishing the business case for implementing Guidewire InsuranceSuite products. Business Case or Value Consulting Workshops are led by Guidewire’s Strategic Advisory Team to help customers focus on implementing solutions with strategic benefits for their organization. During a Value Consulting workshop, the carrier’s strategic imperatives and business objectives are linked to specific benefits in a Strategic Value Map.

To ensure the changes have value, every change should be evaluated against the strategic value map. Then, each user story should be linked to a specific benefit during a Benefits Mapping Workshop. Otherwise, money might be spent making changes that are not targeting strategic benefits instead of spending it on changes that do.

AStrategic Value Map can be used to link weighted business objectives for the release to themes for enhancements during Inception. Business Analyst find this resource a valuable reference when preparing for requirements elaboration workshops and to assist with decision-making later in the project.

## Guidewire Training Resources

As mentioned, Pre-Inception is when business resources are trained on the product and on the Guidewire approach to implementation. Guidewire offers InsuranceSuite product training with hands-on practice to learn how products work in the base configuration. It is important to understand how the base configuration of the product works in order to translate the “how it’s done today” business process to how the Guidewire product handles that same business process.

Guidewire offers our implementation methodology training in the course: SurePath Overview to help project team members learn our recommend Agile approach. This training includes lessons-learned from over 300 successful implementations and walks participants through the different phases, roles and key tools used in Guidewire projects. It also teaches our process for enabling requirements with Guidewire products. You are already starting your Guidewire Training journey by taking this course.

Image

## Guidewire educational Portal

The education portal allows you to access current and previous training courses that you have signed-up for. The materials for this course, and other courses you participate in, are available to you throughout the duration of your implementation project. Use them as a reference before elaboration sessions to refresh your memory.

You can access training resources and course materials through the Education Portal at education.guidewire.com. your email will be your username.

Guidewire also provides certification options for users involved with product configuration, integration and business analysis.

# 5. Resources for Inception

The goal of the Inception Phase is to confirm the scope and estimates for the project as well as to plan the project iterations for the Development phase.

This is done through a series of week-long workshops to confirm the preliminary scope and estimate for the development of the user stories. The user stories are committed to the project backlog in a project management tool like Jira. The Conceptual Sprint Plan, the Infrastructure plans, and Integration High-Level Designs are created. This is also when the sandbox environment is installed, prject resources are trained on standard features of the product and introduced to Agile concepts. This training is needed when reviewing the base configuration and functionality of the product to perform a gap analysis and identify requirements for any changes that are needed.

image

## Implementation Methodology Resources

During Inception, project teams are introduced to the Agile concepts used by the Guidewire Implementation Methodology: SurePath. The Guidewire Implementation model, itself is great resource for implementation projects because it is a project model that is optimized for Property and Casualty Insurance System implementations. By following the SurePath methodology, project teams are guided to use a process that focuses on Value, Delivery and Knowledge Transfer.

Resources to aid in flowing this approach can be found in the InsuranceSuite Implementation Collateral Library for internal employees or the community site for external users. When leveraging these resources and enablement assets, project teams gain expert guidance for project health and success and learn how to optimize scope for base work and changes, while making sure changes are value aligned to prioritize discretionary spend. In fact, by leveraging Guidewire content for common needs (5000 enablement assets), project temas can reduce project effort, lessen or eliminate design work, and streamline the implementation plan.

image

## Tools/Templates - Business Process Flows

The InsuranceSuite Implementation Collateral Library provides a variety of tools to customers to assist in streamlining their implementation process during Inception.

Including:

- Mindmaps

- Miro boards

- Business Process Flows

- System Process Flows for base processes

- User Stories and User Story Cards

- Integration High-Level and Detailed Designs

image

1. MindMaps
    
    Mind maps are diagrams that are used to visually organize information and can be created using a free version of the X-Mind application developed by X-Mind Ltd.
    
    At the beginning of Inception, MindMaps are great tools for creating a holistic view of the implementation Scope. They can be used to further map out and update Project Deliverables like Process Flows, Product Models or Integration High-Level Designs per brainstorming results.
    
    For PolicyCenter, Business Analysts use this visual tool to aid in designing new insurance product. In fact, our Advanced Product Designer tool allows the import of mindmaps directly into PolicyCenter to expedite the new product development process.
    
    image
    

2. Business Analyst Job Aid in Miro
    
    Miro is another useful project planning tool for InsuranceSuite implementations. This whiteboarding application enables project teams to share information and collaborate creating dashboards with digital sticky notes.
    
    Guidewire has developed several Miro board templates for implementation projects.
    
    One example is the Business Analyst Job Aid. This Miro board contains a series of cards that outline common tasks for business Analysts during each phase of the project lifecycle.
    
    New Business Analysts find this tool especially useful when onboarding by:
    
    - Helping them understand what is expected of them at each phase of the project
    
    - Outlining the tasks they should be prepared to perform
    
    - Alerting them to available planning aids
    
    The board itself can be copied as a template to a project space in Miro and modified to meet specific project needs. For instance, tags can be added or modified to flag tasks for a particular role or topig. Frames can be added to identify tasks for specific sprints, and hyperlinks can be added to direct team members to additional documentation or resources.
    
    As mentioned Miro boards can be used to increase collaboration on a project. Team members can add notes or comments to ensure a common understanding of tasks.  
    They can also be exported and distributed to a larger group for stakeholders to review.

3. System & Process Flow Maps
    
    Guidewire provides process maps for each product that map key activities to the screens in the product. Process maps help Business Analysts drive discussions during Inception
    
    image
    

4. HLDs
    
    A great resource for development or integration is our library of prespective Integration High-Level Designs or HLDs.
    
    Currently, there are over 30HDLs for integrations that are standard on most projects.  
    They provide guidance along with an approach for how they should be implemented.  
    These designs reduce effort and in some cases, completely eliminate design work.  
    Additionally, Professional Services has invested in building out the detailed desings and reference code for many of these 30 integrations. These reference implementations can reduce integration efforts by 50% to 60% or more.
    
    image
    

5. Story Cards
    
    In the InsuranceSuite Implementation Collateral library, Guidewire has more than 5000 user story cards for project teams to leverage. Story cards are Excel templates that help capture funcitonal requirements for each user story. The story card captures mocked-up screens, business rules for default values, field names, formatting logic for date fields, and the business rules for default values, field names, formatting logic for date fields, and the business justification for significant changes to the base product along with approvals. User story cards are grouped and listed by Theme and Feature or Sub-Theme. The list of standard user stories is augmented when new stories are identified during the Inception phase.
    
    image
    
    - The user Story Handbook
    
    The User Story Handbook is an resource that offers guidance on the role of user stories during each project phase. For example, it illustrates hoe user stories are used in elaboration workshops during Inception, in backlog refinement, in the requirements refinement workshops and in writing acceptance criteria.
    
    In addition to reviewing processes and terminology related to elaborating requirements, the User Story Handbook provides specific guidance to business analysts on how to document requiments in the Guidewire User Story Cards. For example, the handbook reviews where requirements should be documented by listing the specific tabs and highlighting common fileds for Business Analysts to complete versus tabs or fields that should be completed by developers.
    
    The handbook also provides general guidance on best practices when documenting the story cards.
    
    All of which helps to achieve the goal of this handbook: to ensure consistency in business analysis practice and solution delivery.
    
    image
    

6. Guidewire Community Resources
    
    The Guidewire Community site, provides access to knowledge articles, product documentation, software downloads, user groups, community discussions and much more. Also, this is where you can contact Guidewire Customer Support by creating a case. Training material for using the Guidewire Community are also found on this site.

# 6. Resources for Sprint 0

During Sprint 0, the goal is to prepare and plan for Development Execution by planning the specific details for early iterations.

Sprint 0 is really considered part of the Development phase or a two to four-week “transition sprint” to Development. This time is often used as an opportunity to get a jumpstart on development by elaborating the functional requirements and completing the User Story Cards for the first Sprint. This way development can begin immediately with the start of the Development phase.

The Development team is also prepared for development by attending training and certification programs. Preparing for development also includes setting up the Development environments.

image

- Conceptual Sprint Plan

The Conceptual Sprint Plan or CSP is a high-level sprint plan outlined in an Excel template. If using the Estimate Release Planner, the backlog of user stories can be imported into the Conceptual Sprint Planning tool to assist in creating a conceptual sprint plan.

A conceptual Sprint Plan is usually delivered at the end of the Inception phase and referenced throughout Development. The CSP provides guidance on which stories are prioritized for development and when. During Sprint 0, large stories often need to be broken down into smaller stories and reprioritized. The CSP can be refined as needed during monthly priorization meetings to ensure the team is always working on the areas that provide the most value and address high-risk areas.

image

- Reference Resources

Another resource you may find helpful in Guidewire implementation project are third party references produced by the international institue of Business Analysis.  
The documents provide the industry standard body of knowledge for business analysis and are widely used in many industries. Resources on Agile and Scrum methods will also help you understand Guidewire’s implementation model. Resource on Business-Drive Development, or BDD, will help team members understand how we build quality into the process

image

- Experts

The Guidewire Staffing Model for implementation projects suggest forming an “Ecosystem of expertise” by leveraging various experts as resources. You can refer to your subject matter experts, or people in your company who know business process, to answer the “how and why” questions and to provide data for analysis.

Or you can rely on Guidewire Services Team Members, which include Core Team members, Certified Prodcut Experts, Donfiguration and Integration Specialists and experts in Specialized Services.

image

- Guidewire Products

The product, itself, is a great resource for providing adhoc or scheduled demonstrations, as a canvas or backdrop for elaboration requirements and when assessing the behavior or functionality of the base configuration and whether it supports the carrier’s business process.

In addition to environments that include the latest customer configuration, each customer can maintain a “pure” version of the product’s base configuration or a sandbox. A sandbox environment is useful for learning about the original features and functionality or how it worked before it was changed. This is especially useful when troubleshooting defects in later stages of the project to determine if there are truly product defects or issues introduced by configuration.

image

- Product Documentation

The Product Documentation provides information about how the product works and how it can be changed. The Product Documentation comes bundled with the software as fully-searchable and hyperlinked documentation which covers all aspects of the product. For ex:

- Application Guides

- InsuranceSuite Guides

- System Administration Guides

- Best Practices Guides

- Configuration Guides

The documentation is geared toward all types of users from business users and developers to system administrators.

Aside from offering development resources from application guides to configuration guides, the Guidewire Documentation site provides a comprehensive library of Guidewire Cloud Standards. Go to [cods.guidewire.com](http://cods.guidewire.com) for the latest Guidewire Cloud Standards. Guidewire Cloud Standards can alos be accessed via the link provided on the Guidewire Community - community-guidewire.com

The Standards are designed to facilitate implementations by defining how Guidewire products should be implemented or extended to meet security requirements, performance SLAs, upgradability and test coverage when deployed to Guidewire Cloud. As such, all Guidewire Cloud implementation projects must adhere to the adoption of the standards, while not mandatory, will help ensure a more seamless transition to Cloud.

---

# 7. Resources for Development

During the Development phase, activities are focused on the goal of enabling User Stories with Technology. These activities are done through a seires of month-long iteration where Developers collaborate with Business Analysts and Quality Analysts to define, devlop and test the build out the user stories.

Development begins with complete Conceptual Sprint outlining the schedule for development for items on the backlog. Following an Agile Delivery Approach, User Stories are Elaborated, Developed, Tested and Accepted as they are brought. To Production Qaulity Burn Down Reports and Velocity Reports are used to track progress of development of the user stories.

image

- Configuration Resources

The Data Dictionary provides information about the product’s entity model. The Data Dictionary documents the current configuration of the data model and the Security Dictionary documents current roles and permissions. Both dictionaries document configuration changes made to support the Insurance Carrier’s business requirements.

image

- Guidewire Product Tools

Guidewire has product tools as resources as well.

As Guidewire products include a set of keyboard shorcuts that ca be used from the user interface to diplay information about the underlying application. For Ex:

- Alt + Shift + I : to display location information for the pcf file

- Alt + Shift + W : to display the widget inspector and page structure

- Alt + Shift + E : to open and display a pc file directly in Guidewire Studio

Guidewire Studio is a Developer’s tool for configuring changes in InsuranceSuite products. This tool is very useful for Business Analysts working with Developers when defects are found. Technical Business Analysts may also be given access to Guidewire Studio.

Product Designer and Advanced Product Designer, or APD, are tools used with PolicyCenter to define new products and policy lines.

- Guidewire GO products

For insures who want to replace core systems and are looking for a way to make that replacement fast and easy, Guidewire has developed Guidewire Go products. This program offers as fast and reliable way to launch new products on the Guidewire Cloud Platform. Guidewire GO enables insurers to get out latest product content, line of business-specific, resources and trusted implementation projects, all in a package available on the Guidewire Marketplace. Guidewire GO accelerates implementation projects, while allowing insurers to tailor content for their business.

image

- Accelerators and Extension Packs

Accelerators are great resources for development that are designed to help implement Guidewire products faster by reducing development time.

Accelerators include pre-built code or reference implementations to help reduce developer work and so customers are not reinventing the wheel. They are developed by Guidewire or Partners to fill a common need. They are meant to provide the starting point for a particular funcitonality and can be used as part of the configuration for the implementation to meet customer requirements at no cost.

# 8. Resources for Stabilization and Testing

## Stabilization

The activities for Stabilization confirm that the entire system is production ready and set for Deployment. Quality Analysts conduct different types of testing to confirm this.

- End-to-end Testing: involves complete scripted testing of the day-to-day future-state business process. If integrations are involved, End-to-end testing would be conducted using a fully-functional integrated system and with complex scenarios.

- Performance Testing: is also completed to confirm system performance under both normal and peak load in order to identify any performance bottlenecks and to ensure the system can handle the expect load.

- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the testing of the system by End Users with real world scenarios. Toward the end of Stabilization, the transition to Guidewire Support may begin by introducing the customer to their Support Partner and by scheduling of regular support calls.

image

- Resources for Stabilization

Guidewire provides resources for stabilization and testing like training, whitepapers or standards for supported tools or framework on how to use these tools. For automating different types of testing, Guidewire also offers several Testing Frameworks: G-Unit, ISBTF, API Test Bench, APIX, PFT and Gatling.

image

- Standardized Testing Frameworks

A lot of testing is typically done manually, which is slow, expensive and not scalable.  
To help enable testing for stabilization, Guidewire offers standards for testing and standardized frameworks for test automation. Our testing standards aim to reduce costs by providing standard test framework for the various testing types:

- G-Unit is a unit testing framework for Gosu

- GT: API is build on top of Karate and optimized for testing InsuranceSuite Cloud APIs. It can be used to write simpler API unit tests using Karate scenarios and functional E2E tests that leverage Cucumber to support BDD.

- Guidewire Sturio Inspections provides real-time static analysis enable for production code and test automation implementation code.

- InsuranceSuite Behavior Testing Framework also known as I.S.B.T.F is an in-progress framework that leverages Cucumber and is build on top of G-Unit. Guidewire provides more than 200 behavior tests and published SurePath content that may come with I.S.B.T.F tests

- GT: UI is an E2E testing framework that leverages Cucumber with TestCafe and supports behavior-driven development. GT:UI contains GT-Ignite, which generates page objects and can test both PCFs (InsuranceSuite) and Jutro components (Digital).

- GT: Data is a methodology and tools for test data management
