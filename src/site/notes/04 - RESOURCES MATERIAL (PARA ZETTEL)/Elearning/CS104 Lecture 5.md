# Chapter 5: Linked Lists

ðŸš¨

**Linked list:** a series of nodes where each one points to the next one in memory, and each node contains a piece of data.

### **Why do we use Linked Lists?**

- Arrays are simple ways to store blocks of data and dynamically sized arrays let us move on without knowing the array size at _compile time_, but don't help us at _run time_

- Linked lists don't need to know the required number of elements + their size can change dynamically over time
