# Maximizing InsuranceSuite ROI (Return On Investment)

When implementing a new system, insurance companies will frequently try to reinvent features or workflows from their prior system. However, after working with over 190 customers or more than 300 projects, Guidewire has witnessed a guiding principle emerge to maximize return on invesment (ROI) or the value gained from implementing InsuranceSuite, stay as close as possible to the base configuration.

# 1. Benefits of leveraging the base configuration

By maximizing standard features on InsuranceSuite, insurers have found they can:

- Leverage project resources and tools more effectively

- Decrease development time

- Decrease testing

- Decrease maintenance costs

- Decrease future upgrade efforts

- Lower their cost of ownership

Guidewire still encourages customers to reconfigure or customize the application to meet their needs, but also encourages to invest in this effort wisely.  
Customer - specific configurations that neither increase overall process eficency, nor establish a competitive advantage, may not have a positive impact on the long-term cost-to-benefit ratio if customization is needed, do so only when changes:

- Increase overall efficency, or

- Establish a competitive advantage
