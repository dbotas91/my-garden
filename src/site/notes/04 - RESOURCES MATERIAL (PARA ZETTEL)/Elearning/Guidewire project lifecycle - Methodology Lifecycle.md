# 1. Guidewire project lifecycle

The lifecycle consists of five phases: Inception, Development, Stabilization, Deployment and Support. Inception, Development and Stabilization are done as a set of sprints, so each step in the phases is repeated many times during that phase.

Development, Stabilization and Deployment are considered “Delivery” phases. The project tracking and guidance are in place across all phases of the lifecycle.

1. Pre-Inception:
    
    The goal is to prepare and plan for Inception Execution. This phase establish the Inception logistics, train the key business team members and key Pre-Inception deliverables:
    
    - Business case completed;
    
    - Inception logistics established;
    
    - Inception workshops scheduled;
    
    - Business resources trained;
    
    - User stories mapped to business case;
    
    - Project governance defined;
    
    - Methodology aligned;
    
    - Project tools identified;
    

2. Inception:
    
    In the inception phase, the team reviews the base configuration functionality and identifies requirements for any changes needed. Usually this is a 3-4 weeks sprint.
    
    The Goal is to confirm scope, estimates and plan the project iterations. The Agile concepts are introduced and the key Inception deliverables are set:
    
    - Estimated user stories;
    
    - Commited product backlog;
    
    - Conceptual sprint plan;
    
    - Infrastructure plan;
    
    - Integration context diagram;
    
    - GAP analysis;
    
    - High level integration designs;
    
    - Sandbox installed;
    
    - Trainned resources;
    

3. Development:
    
    For Sprint 0 the goal is to prepare and plan the Development Execution. This is the beginning of the transition to 2-4 weeks sprints. The plan for development should be defined and development team should start to be prepared. For Sprint 0 the deliverables should be:
    
    - Setup development environments;
    
    - Plan specific details for early iteration;
    
    - Elaborate requirments for Sprint 1;
    
    - Confirm Project Methodology;
    
    - Trainned Development Resources;
    
    - Definition of Done;
    
    After sprint 0, the general Development begins. The goal is to enable User Stories with technology. This time, series of month-long iterations are defined to build out User Stories. The key Inception deliverables are:
    
    - Planned sprint
    
    - Sprint backlog
    
    - Burn Down Reports;
    
    - Accept User stories - elaborated, developed, tested, accepted, production quality;
    
    - Updated Velocity Reports;
    
    - Reprioritized backlog;
    
    In Development phase it is really important that each part of it asks and answers to the right questions:
    
    BA:
    
    - How simillar is the future state process to the systems base configuration process?
    
    - Are the desired changes driving significant competitive advantage?
    
    - Are we capturing business and process driven requirements, or design driven requirements?
    
    - Are our larger effort stories supporting our value Alignment directives and our value consulting report/business case?
    
    Developer:
    
    - What are the options available to enable the business requirments and their corresponding efforts?
    
    - Are there unique development implications/efforts that need to be addressed in the estimates?
    
    - Are there technology risks that need to be called out in the story or esimates?
    
    - Are there technical dependencies that will impact the order of the conceptual sprint plans?
    
    QA:
    
    - Are the business requirements testable, and what effort is needed to create and execute the tests?
    
    - Are there performance (load, volume, and so on) concerns in this user story that should be estimated?
    
    - Are there unique testing efforts or risks that need to be addressed in the estimates?
    

4. Stabilization:
    
    The goal is to confirm the production quality of the stories for development. This is the beginning of End to End Testing, working on complete scripdted day to day state business process testing and adding fully functional integrated system with complex scenarios. Besides this, Performance testing starts aiming to confirm system performance under normal and peak load and eventual performance bottlenecks.
    
    At the same time the User Acceptance testing begins, where the end users starts to test the system with real world scenarios. Guidewire provides a support transition, making the introduction to support partner and scheduling regular support calls.
    

5. Deployment:
    
    The goal is to enable End Users to start using the system in production. The series of deployment typically starts with a pilot deployment, following data migration from legacy systems to new system.
    
    In this fase is really important to train the new end users - internal and external - and promote communication with customers.
    

6. Support and success: at the end, the goal is to realize the value of the production guidewire system. In this way, maintenance updates and planned and enhancement requests should be responded.

# 2. Delivery Model

The Delivery Model is split betwen Inception and Delivery,

- Inception - is split into multiple 1 week sprints

- Delivery - is split in sprints, each lasting 3-4 weeks on average

[![](Dashboard/Attachments/Untitled%202%2011.png)](Guidewire%20project%20lifecycle%20-%20Methodology%20Lifecycl/Untitled%202.png)

- Delivery approach - cross - functional teams
