# Pay attention in class

- Don’t overload the system

- Your mind depends on your body to function well and vice versa

- Eat healthy

- Exercise regularly

- Get enough sleep

- Sit up front and be present

- This will force you to be attentive as you’re at a spot closest to the lecturer. You don’t wanna give a bad impression lol.

- Come prepared

- Get ready all your books, laptop, water bottle, pencil case etc. for your class.

- Be ready the night before.

- Be there at your class at least 15 minutes earlier to settle down.

- Even if you’re late or on time, don’t worry, shit happens and it will pass too.

- Get help from your lecturers always

- Not only it helps you to comprehend something you don’t exactly understand, you’ll also build a relationship with your lecturers

- But before you ask, ask yourself: what is it that I don’t understand?

- Try to solve it as much as you can. You might even solve it before you ask.

- When you ask, you should be able to let the lecturer know that you understand up to a point and even show that you understand his explanations afterwards, truly.

- Like that, they actually know that you give a damn and hence have a good impression of you. You save his time and help them understand the context of your problem.

- 15-minute rule

- Confront a question, give yourself 15 minutes to solve, remember everything you try. If it remains unsolved, ask for help.

- Speak up to the class discussions

- Take lots of notes during a class

- but only the salient ones, not everything.
