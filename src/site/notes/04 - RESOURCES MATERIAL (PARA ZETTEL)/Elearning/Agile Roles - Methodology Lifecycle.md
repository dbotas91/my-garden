    - Communicate blockers as early as possible
    

Inside the Team Members, there 3 common ones:

1. Business Analysts

2. Developers

3. Quality Analysts and Testers
    1. Business Analyst (BA) - same role and function on an agile project as they do on a waterfall project
        
        1. Teams with end users to understand business requirements
        
        2. Act as a liaison with all stakeholders to ensure clear communication between business and technical groups;
        
        3. Assists with functional requirments and workflow documentation;
        
        4. Works closely with developers and testers during sprint execution so the right features are built and function as the business needs;
        
        5. Always focused on demonstrating value for the end users;
        
        6. Demo to PO for Approval

    2. Responsible for creating design documentation writes code to configure the application or integrate it with other applications/systems
    
    3. Support tests activities during sprint execution to ensure a high-quality, working piece of software is delivered:
        
        1. Executes unit testing
        
        2. Resolves defects
        
        3. Conduct peer code reviews
        
        4. Reviews test plan and test cases

6. Tester (QA):

# 2. The team

Characteristics of effective sprint teams:

- Cross-functional

- Self-organizing

- Autonomous

- Dedicated

- Team size: 10 members

Team success factors - better implementations, improved efficiency, increased accountability and higher quality:

- Frequent communication

- Empowered decision making

- Active business involvement

- High quality resources

- Co-location
    - Co-location has proven benefits, but distributed teams are increasingly common and often unavoidable. Guidewire recommends the following structure:
        
        - Each distributed POD is compromised of one onsite lead and distributed consultants;
        
        - The onsite lead will have responsibility for the work products from the distributed pod and will be responsible for all the interactions with the distributed consultants.
        
        - Conduct full product and methodology trainning to enable both teams to perform equally and to create a sens of inclusion
