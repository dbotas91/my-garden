# 1. Layers of planning

We do not know everything at the beginning of the project, so we plan based on what we do know and then re-evaluate as needed. It is much like peeling an onion.

To start break down the work for the project, we should start by looking at common processes in each product - Themes - each InsuranceSuite product - PC, BC, CC - has a set of themes that identify the common processes within the product.

Themes are common processes within each InsuranceSuite product. Each theme is then broken down into features, user stories, and eventually tasks.

Each theme is broken down into features - subthemes. Each feature contains multiple user stories. There are standard user stories for each product and common lines of business.

Each User Story is broken down in tasks, which are captured and estimated during sprint planning sessions.

Guidewire provides more than 5000 assets to help customers jumpt-start the project and avoid re-creating the wheel.

The list of standard user stories is grouped by themes for all base products, and the teams can augment the list with new stories that are identified during the project.

- Estimation Planner tool
    
    The estimation tool includes complex logic to quickly estimate user stories based on multiple criteria unique to the organization and project strategy. It is used to estimate the project and drive Inception activities.
    

- Conceptual Sprint Plan
    
    A high-level sprint plan is delivered at the end of Inception. This provides guidance on which stories are prioritized when. During sprint 0, we break down large stories and reprioritize stories as needed. The sprint plan is refined during monthly priorization meetings to ensure the team is always working on the areas that provide the most value and/or address high-risk areas.

    Besides that, Guidewire provides process maps for each product that map key activities to the screens in the product. Process maps help drive discussions during inception.
    

- Story cards
    
    Guidewire has more than 5000 story cards in our methodology library. Story cards are Excel templates that help cature key requirements for each user story. Key requirements include business rules - default values, field names, formation logic, etc. The story card also captures mocked-up screens, business justification for significant changes to the base product, and approvals.
    

- Accelerators for integrations
    
    Accelerator are designed to help implement Guidewire products faster. Accelerators may include pre-built code or reference implementations to help reduce developer work so customers are not reinventing the wheel. Guidewire has several hundred accelerators available to customers including accelerators for common integrations.
