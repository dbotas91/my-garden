Curriculum overview

The following is the recommended path I‚Äôd take to learn Python, data science and machine learning on Coursera (with little to no prior experience). It is code focused, meaning the goal is to start writing as much machine learning code as possible. More specifically‚Ä¶

**Curriculum focus:**

1. Learn Python code as well as data science and machine learning fundamentals.

2. Be able to look at a data problem and understand what‚Äôs needed to solve it.

3. Be able to communicate and contribute data science and machine learning code to others.

**Key:**

- The ==green dashed square== contains ==courses all available within Coursera Plus==.

- The ==blue dashed square== contains data analytics courses which are for those who would like to focus on data analytics.

- The ==orange dashed square== contains advanced courses from the [Deeplearning.AI](http://Deeplearning.AI) program that are focused on machine learning however **require a base knowledge of machine learning and Python coding** to get started.

üí°

Starting from the **beginner section requires no prerequisites**. Other sections such as advanced has prerequisites (these can be obtained by completing the beginner steps).

A pathway for learning machine learning and data science on Coursera in 2022. [See the full interactive chart online](https://whimsical.com/how-to-learn-data-science-in-2022-with-coursera-3SCvPGquc1GFxYJJ2pqw7C).

## Curriculum outline

All of the following are included the in the [Coursera Plus](https://dbourke.link/coursera-plus-2022-deal) subscription.

**Key:**

- ==Green rows== are Python, data science and machine learning fundamentals and are **highly recommended**.

- ==Blue rows== have a **data analytics** focus and are optional (if you complete the green rows, you could skip these and go to the ‚ÄúExtra-curriculum‚Äù section).

- ==Purple rows== are bonus materials for what to do _after_ completing a series of courses and learning fundamental skills.

üí°

For the context of this article, **data science** involves using data to understand the future, whereas **data analytics** involves using data to understand the past. And **machine learning** is a powerful technique used in data science.

|**Course Number**|**Course Name**|**Why**|**What it covers**|
|---|---|---|---|

Before you start writing machine learning and data science code, it‚Äôs best to learn the fundamentals of Python.|Installing Python, writing your first Python program, writing various Python data structures.|
|3|[**Applied Data Science with Python Specialization**](https://dbourke.link/coursera-data-science-python)|Python is a general programming language meaning it‚Äôs capable of writing many different kinds of programs. If you‚Äôve learned some fundamental Python, it‚Äôs time to start writing data science specific Python with the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization.|Pandas Python library (for manipulating data), NumPy library (for numerical computing), Matplotlib library (for visualizing data), data cleaning, Scikit-Learn library (for machine learning algorithms).|
|4|[**Machine Learning Specialization**](https://dbourke.link/coursera-machine-learning-specialization)|The Applied Data Science with Python taught you how to visualize and manipulate data, now it's time to find out how to find patterns in it using machine learning algorithms.|Machine learning concepts, classification algorithms, regression aglorithms, clustering algorithms, decision trees (a type of machine learning algorithm).|
|5|[**Mathematics for Machine Learning**](https://dbourke.link/coursera-math-for-ml)|All of the machine learning code you write often triggers mathematics under the hood. The Mathematics for Machine Learning specialization will help you understand what's happening behind the scenes of your Python code.|Linear algebra, multivariable calculus.|
|**Bonus 1 (recommended)**|**[Google Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://dbourke.link/coursera-intro-to-git-and-github)**|Git and GitHub are two of the most important tools when it comes to writing software (I use them everyday I write code). Git keeps track of different versions of your code and GitHub helps you share it and collaborate with others.|Using Git, using GitHub, creating pull requests on GitHub.|
|**Bonus 2 (optional)**|[**Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**](https://dbourke.link/coursera-google-data-analytics)|Data analytics uses data to understand the past. Since many different companies now use data to drive their business, knowing how to analyse their data can make you a prime candidate for a future role.|Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, data calculations, SQL programming.|
|**Bonus 3 (optional)**|**[Learn SQL Basics for Data Science](https://dbourke.link/coursera-sql-basics-for-data-science)**|SQL (structured query language) is the language of databases. Think of a giant Excel spreadsheet but being able to access it and manipulate it writing code. You can use Python to do so but often you may also have to use SQL. So knowing a bit of SQL can go a long way.|SQL programming for filtering, sorting and summarizing data, accessing spreadsheets and creating datasets using SQL.|
|**Bonus 4**|Read through **[‚ÄúHow can a beginner data scientist like me gain experience?‚Äù](https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-can-a-beginner-data-scientist-like-me-gain-experience/)**|So you‚Äôve completed some courses? And now you‚Äôre looking for a job? This article will give you some ideas on what to do.|Tips and ideas on how to put the skills you‚Äôve been learning to use and showcase them to potential employers. Hell, even skip the employer and go straight to building your own thing.|

Extra-curriculum

If you‚Äôre looking for extra-curriculum or to get a job in the field after completing the above courses, try the following.

- For an idea of what you can do after gaining some fundamental skills in data science, read ["How can a beginner data scientist like me gain experience?"](https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-can-a-beginner-data-scientist-like-me-gain-experience/).

- **[Andrew Ng‚Äôs Machine Learning classic machine learning course](https://dbourke.link/coursera-machine-learning)** ‚Äî the courses above focus on writing Python code, however if you‚Äôre interested in learning much of the theory behind the Python code you‚Äôre writing, I‚Äôd highly recommend the classic Stanford Machine Learning course.

- After completing the fundamentals (green rows above), you may want to push your machine learning skills even further. In that case, the [Deeplearning.AI](http://Deeplearning.AI) programs are where you‚Äôll want to go. **Note:** Deeplearning.AI courses are not included with Coursera Plus. I‚Äôd recommend starting with the following.
    
    - **[Deep Learning Specialization](https://dbourke.link/coursera-deep-learning)** ‚Äî Taught by Andrew Ng (one of the OG‚Äôs of machine learning and deep learning), this specialization will teach you all about the powerful machine learning technique known as deep learning. Typically if you‚Äôre working with structured data (rows and columns, like an Excel spreadsheet), you‚Äôll use decision tree and gradient boosted algorithms but if you‚Äôre working with unstructured data (images, natural language, sound), you‚Äôll use deep learning algorithms.
    
    - **[TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://dbourke.link/tfinpractice)** ‚Äî TensorFlow is a Python-based deep learning framework created by Google but now it‚Äôs open-source. It‚Äôs one of the most powerful and popular deep learning libraries out there. This certificate course will get you up to speed writing deep learning algorithms with TensorFlow as well as prepare you to pass the TensorFlow Developer Certification (optional).
    
    - **[Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps)](https://dbourke.link/coursera-mlops)** ‚Äî Once you‚Äôve built a bunch of machine learning models, chances are you‚Äôll want to enable others to use them. But how do you do that? That‚Äôs where MLOps (machine learning operations) comes in. This course will teach you the steps needed to get your machine learning models into the hands of others through websites or mobile applications. It‚Äôll also highlight many of the problems you‚Äôll run into when doing so.
