1. **Which of the following lists contains only typical exit criteria from testing?**
    
    1. Reliability measures, test coverage, test cost, availability of test environment, time to market and product completeness.
    
    2. Time to market, remaining defects, tester qualification, availability of testable use cases, test coverage and test cost.
    
    3. Reliability measures, test coverage, degree of testerâ€™s independence and product completeness.
    
    4. Reliability measures, test coverage, schedule and status about fixing defect and remaining risks.
    
    - Answer

2. **Which one of the following is NOT included in a test summary report?**
    
    1. defining pass/fail criteria and objectives of testing
    
    2. deviations from the test approach
    
    3. measurements of actual progress against exit criteria

    1. coverage of requirements by source code
    
    2. percentage of test cases already created and reviewed
    
    3. percentage of executed test cases
    
    4. average number of testers involved in the test execution

        **Correta**
        
        **Test case execution (e.g. number of test cases run/not run, and test cases passed/failed).**
        

4. **Which of the following statements BEST describes how tasks are divided between the test manager and the tester?**
    
    1. The test manager plans and organizes the testing and specifies the test cases, while the tester executes the tests.
    
    2. The test manager plans, monitors, and controls the testing activities, while the tester designs tests and decides on the release of the test object.
