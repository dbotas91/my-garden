### About Me

🍀

Hey! I'm an SDE at ABC International. I've majored in Computer Science with a Minor in Design. Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by technology and how it works, I've had a knack for it and effortlessly chose to pursue Computer Science. I've always wanted to be a part of the process of a creating an application and building it from ground up! I'm also drawn to design and sketching, which is why I'm so excited to pursue opportunities that are an intersection of technology and design.  
Apart from my technical skills, I'm an coffee addict, an avid reader, and do freelance design works in my free time.
