# Reading

- Don’t do all your assigned reading.

- Primary reading: read all required textbooks and other possibly important materials

- Secondary reading: just skim through articles, case studies required to read etc.

- Always gauge(carefully consider and judge) your class to know what material is actually important for reading for your exams.

- The goal is to reduce study time and increase learning efficiency

- Imagine you’re conversing with an intelligent friend. If she talks, you listen intently. If she stops, you contribute your own ideas together with the material.

- Use **pseudo-skimming method**

- Skim through the texts and read slowly when you come across important parts.

- Read the chapter backwards (non-suspenseful ones)

- You’ll see a list of vocabulary terms, review questions etc.

- These will give you an overall picture of what you’ll be reading later (prime your brain). Exposing yourself earlier to those terms helps you to grasp(understand) them easier later.

- Create questions as you read

- Note down salient points as you read or immediately after you read.

- Create questions with the points from your reading assignments.

- Use the section heading as the basis of your question.

- Pay attention to formatting

- **Bolded**, _italicised_ words or in lists should be taken seriously.

- Mark up your chapters

- Use a highlighter or pencil to highlight the salient(most important) parts of the chapter.

- Take actual notes

- Like now.

- As you read or immediately after you read on a separate notebook or electronic device.

- Once you’ve finished doing it, go through the same chapter again and jot down anything you missed.

- Summarise what you’ve read

- Teaching someone will help you with the goal of being able to communicate it in a form that will be understandable to someone less knowledgeable than you.
