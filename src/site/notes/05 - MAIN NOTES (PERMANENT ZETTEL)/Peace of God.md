Today I wanted to talk to you about God's peace. The peace that Paul speaks in Philippians 4: 7 "And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus." 

To realize what God's peace is, we need to be at peace with God first. And a man today can only be at peace with God when he places his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, believing in Him as his Only and sufficient Savior. 

However, make no mistake, "Peace with God" and "Peace of God" are different things. 

We enjoy "Peace of God" after being in "Peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ". (Rom. 4:25; 5: 1) 

On the other hand, we can be at peace with God and not enjoy the peace of God. 

Sometimes when we hear "Peace of God" we think of other things like for example: 

 - if we are at peace with God, the peace of God is not having more afflictions, not having more problems, everything will go well in our life. This is an illusion that everyone will learn bitterly. 

It is also our mistake, if we think that, because we are at peace with God, we will necessarily enjoy the "Peace of God". 

On the contrary, we will experience many afflictions, problems, tribulations. Perhaps more than we can imagine or think. 

When these moments arrive, they are accompanied by anxiety, uncertainty, doubts, suffering, in other words, the pain arrives. 

But we can still have the peace of God in all these moments. 

Let us look at Job's case to see what tribulations really are. 

Job was a very rich man, probably the combination of Bill Gates with Donal Trump and Ross Perot. In addition, he was healthy, rich, good, godly and God-fearing. But not inaccessible. 

He had a monopoly on selling and consuming his 7,000 sheep's own wool. 

We see their livelihood coming from these animals and acres of crops. He had 3000 camels, probably used in the rental, distribution and / or transport business. There were 1000 oxen working in pairs to plow the fertile fields. 500 mules used in milk production. 

Job had a happy and healthy family, with 10 adult children living nearby. 

Job was in complete control of everything, he was famous because of his wealth, integrity, godliness and fear of God. 

In addition, Job was zealous about his life and that of his children. He got up very early to offer burnt offerings according to the number of all his children, had they not sinned and blasphemed against God. (Job 1: 1-5) 

He was a fantastic man, an example of fidelity, piety, integrity, faith, patience .. 

Until one day he lost everything. 

That day came to an end, and he had lost all his monopoly, his wealth, perhaps even his fame and especially his beloved children. 

In a tone of humiliation, Job tore the best clothes he had worn, shaved his head (in a tone of humiliation), fell on the ground, and worshiped God. 

Besides worshiping, he did not blame God for his loss. How many of us would do that? I would not do that! Because I am much worse than Job. (Job 1: 13-22) 

We often think that it is only good to serve God and that we should only do it in our prosperity, in our old age. When everything is going well in our lives .. What an illusion it is to think like that .. , friends, brothers in Christ .. 

Not!! We must serve the Lord, use our gifts in His work every day in our lives. 

To make matters worse, Job became very ill, lost his wife and even endured the rejection of his friends who criticized him to justify his pain. 

We see that he suffered from: 

inflamed, ulcerative wounds Job 2: 7 

Continuous itching 2: 8 

Degenerative changes in the skin of the face, disfigurement 2:12 

Loss of appetite 3:24 

Fear and depression 3:25 

Purulent wounds that open, itch, crack and fester 7: 5 

Worms formed in wounds 7: 5 

Breathing difficulties 9:18 

Blackening of the eyelid 16:16 

Bad breath 19:17 

Weight loss 19:20; 33:21 

Excruciating, continuous pain 30:27 

High fever with chills and skin discoloration, as well as anxiety and diarrhea 30:30 

Yet he said to his wife, "Will we receive good from God, and not receive evil? In all of this, Job did not sin with his lips." and "the Lord gave it, and the Lord took it: blessed be the name of the Lord." 

Behold, we regard those who have suffered as blessed. You heard of Job's patience 

James 5:11 

And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;  

And patience, experience; and experience, hope:  

 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.  

Romans 5: 3-5 

We may be experiencing all kinds of difficulties and have the peace of God, but having the peace of God is not immunity against all kinds of difficulties. It is not immunity for us not to have difficulties, problems or pain. 

We can only enjoy the peace of God, even though we are in Job's situation, when we practice what the Bible tells us "Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.  " Philippians 4: 6. - The Lord always wants to be in contact with us, even though he knows our needs, He wants to hear from us about all this and more. 

When we realize that " 

For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:  

Flp 3:21  Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.  

" Philippians 3: 17-21 

It is by leaving our petitions, problems, difficulties, anxieties, etc. At the feet of God, having realized the previous verses, doing it through prayer and pleas always grateful to God, that the next promise will certainly be fulfilled. "And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. " Philippians 4: 7 

We need to pray without ceasing, continue to study the Bible, continue to speak about it, continue to speak about the Lord to everyone. And if we do that, not only will we be busy and doing God's will, but He will be taking care of our affairs in a way that we would never have expected. 

We must give thanks to God in everything in our life, even in extreme suffering! We must be joyful in Him and leave everything in our life in His hands through prayer and reading and studying the Bible. 

We must take our focus, our thinking out of problems and place them in God. The closer we are to Him through prayer, the more we meditate and put His Word into practice, the more He is the priority and the center of our lives, the more the peace of God we will have. 

God's peace is not momentary, it does not come through a click, it does not come through our work, service or effort but through continuous communion with Him. 

The peace of God that Paul spoke about and had. It was not because of his ministry, it was not because of his imprisonments, his illnesses or pains. It came from his constant and very long relationship with the Lord that enabled him to say : 

"And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, because my power is perfected in weakness. I will gladly boast in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. 

That is why I take pleasure in weaknesses, injuries, needs, persecutions, anxieties for Christ's sake. Because when I am weak, then I am strong. " 

2 Corinthians 12: 9,10 

As Christians "... we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called by His decree" (Romans 8:28). Therefore, we must not be constantly disconcerted and defeated by the difficulties and adversities of life, but we must listen to the exhortation: "And the peace of God ... Dominate in your hearts" (Col. 3:15). 

"Now the same Lord of peace will always give you peace in every way ..." (2 Thess. 3:16).
